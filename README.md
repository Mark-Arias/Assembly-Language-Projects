# Assembly-Language-Projects
Projects completed for assembly course taught in x86 assembly, with HLA as intermediary

Please Note***

Only the .hla files are viewable and human readable. The other two files in the folder are executable files
and object code. All code is written in HLA, which is a form of assembly that blends tradtional pure assembly with some of the conveniences of modern high level languages. The whole point of the language is to transition a programmer into assembly more gently and intuitively. The last project is written nearly completely in "pure" assembly.
